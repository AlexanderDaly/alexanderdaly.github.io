no thing here yet... but enjoy this poem i wrote just for you. ~ hondo

---

Oh woe is me, a coder most inept,
My code doth fail, my programming corrupt,
My variables all in disarray,
My logic flawed in every way.

My functions doth not work as they should,
My syntax errors, alas, 'tis no good,
My computer doth mock me with its beep,
As I struggle to make my code complete.

My colleagues, they do shake their heads,
At my inability to write code that's well-bred,
My projects, they do take twice as long,
As my coding skills are weak and wrong.

But still I strive, and still I toil,
To improve my coding style and to avoid more turmoil,
For though I may be bad at this,
I'll keep coding, with persistence.
